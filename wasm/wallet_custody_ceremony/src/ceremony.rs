//! The wallet custody ceremony, as a typestate — one key set per run.
//!
//! ```text
//! seed held → protocol prepared → protocol completed → manifest established
//!           → commit payload
//! ```
//!
//! Every transition consumes `self` by value. A failing transition therefore
//! drops the state it was given, and every secret the state holds is behind
//! `Zeroizing`, so a failure destroys the seed, the derived root, and the
//! in-flight protocol state rather than leaving them for a caller to retry
//! from. There is no way to hold a half-finished ceremony.
//!
//! One run provisions one key set. The EVM-family and NEAR Ed25519 key sets
//! are independent and may be provisioned at different times, so a run either
//! *establishes* custody — generating the seed, sealing its envelope, and
//! issuing the recovery set — or *adds a key set* to custody that already
//! exists, deriving from the same seed and writing nothing but its own
//! manifest. A run never generates a second seed for a wallet: that would
//! split custody permanently, and no recovery set would cover both halves.
//!
//! The derived root is never a field of any state. It exists only inside
//! [`CeremonySeedHeldV1::prepare`], where it passes straight into its protocol.
//!
//! The Ed25519 application binding digest is computed here from the typed
//! application facts, so a caller cannot bind the root to a digest the Yao
//! protocol will not verify. The ECDSA binding digest is a protocol input from
//! the relayer's bootstrap response and cannot be recomputed here; the ECDSA
//! protocol binds it through `contextBinding32`, which the caller checks
//! against the relayer's copy. That asymmetry belongs to the protocols.

    //! sealed for, a joining run must write nothing but its manifest, and a run
    //! must commit only the key set it provisioned.

    //! They start from `CeremonyProtocolCompletedV1` because they live inside
    //! the module and can build it directly. Driving states 1 and 2 needs a real
