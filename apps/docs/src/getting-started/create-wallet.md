# Create a wallet

Call `registerPasskey` from a user-initiated action. The SDK opens the passkey
prompt, reports progress, and returns a discriminated result that tells you
which capability is ready.

## Register a passkey wallet

Use the hook when your product owns the registration button and result UI.
Render `CreateWalletButton` inside the `SeamsWebProvider` from [Start
here](/).

<<< ../examples/registration.tsx

The example treats `result.success` as the only gate and logs the branch
`kind`. Read branch-specific fields, such as a NEAR provisioning state, only
after checking the branch.

## Read the result

- `wallet_registered` means the wallet and its returned capabilities are ready.
- `ecdsa_wallet_registered_near_pending` means the EVM-family capability is
  ready while NEAR provisioning is pending or retryable. This branch carries no
  NEAR account id — await `seams.registration.awaitNearReady({ walletId })`
  before signing NEAR.
- `near_wallet_registered_pending` means NEAR provisioning still needs to
  reach a ready state before you read a NEAR account.
- `wallet_signer_added` means a signer was added to an existing wallet.
- `success: false` contains the error text to show or log for the current
  attempt.

The returned `walletId` is the stable wallet identifier used by signing,
session provisioning, and every other wallet-scoped operation. Keep it with your application account record;
never store passkey or holder secrets in application state.

## If registration stops

Passkey cancellation ends the current attempt. Let the person start a new
attempt from the same button. A retryable NEAR provisioning result keeps the
wallet identity, so check provisioning before offering a retry instead of
registering a second wallet:

- `seams.registration.awaitNearReady({ walletId })` waits for provisioning to
  settle and resolves with `near_ready`, `near_failed_retryable`, or
  `timed_out`. It never rejects unless you abort it with a `signal`.
- `seams.registration.getNearProvisioningState({ walletId })` reads the current
  state without waiting.

Origin, publishable-key, and authentication errors require configuration or
account changes before retrying.
