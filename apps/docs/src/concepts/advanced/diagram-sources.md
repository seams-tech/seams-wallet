# Diagram sources

Architecture diagrams render in docs with Mermaid code blocks. Source copies
live under `/diagrams/` so the same diagrams can be reused in issues, plans,
and external materials.

| Diagram                              | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/diagrams/platform-layers.mmd`      | Product-layer map from proof to policy, execution, and audit.                             |
| `/diagrams/runtime-architecture.mmd` | Runtime component map for app origin, wallet iframe, Router, Derivers, and SigningWorker. |
| `/diagrams/router-ab-flows.mmd`      | Split derivation path and normal signing path.                                            |
| `/diagrams/custody-boundaries.mmd`   | Material boundaries across client, Router, Derivers, and SigningWorker.                   |
| `/diagrams/delegated-lanes.mmd`      | Linked-device and delegated-agent lane shape.                                             |

SVG export is deferred until a target surface needs static images.
