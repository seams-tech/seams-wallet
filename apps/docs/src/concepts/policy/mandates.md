# Mandates

A mandate records what a delegated actor may do.

```text
This subject may perform this class of action, under this policy, until this
expiry, within this budget, against this exact intent shape.
```

Mandates connect user approval to agent execution. Each mandate should have a defined
scope and typed fields. It should support revocation and an audit trail.

## Core fields

| Field        | Role                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subject      | User, org role, wallet, device, agent, or service.                                |
| Intent shape | The typed action family the mandate may authorize.                                |
| Constraints  | Budget, merchant, recipient, chain, marketplace, geography, time, and risk rules. |
| Policy epoch | Versioned policy state for revocation-sensitive decisions.                        |
| Expiry       | Hard lifetime for the delegated authority.                                        |
| Audit facts  | Evidence needed to explain what was allowed or denied.                            |

## Examples

- A shopping agent may buy one jacket under USD 500 from approved merchants.
- A bidding agent may bid up to a fixed ceiling on one listing.
- A merchant support agent may issue refunds up to a configured amount.
- A backend service may execute one wallet intent under a delegated lane.

Mandates do not replace signing controls. They constrain when signing or another
execution adapter may proceed.
