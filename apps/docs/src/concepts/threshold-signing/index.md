# Threshold signing

Threshold signing lets Seams split signing authority across holder-side and
server-side material. A valid signature requires the selected holder lane and
admitted server participation.

Normal signing uses signing shares produced by earlier derivation or activation
steps. The wallet key is not reconstructed for ordinary signatures.

## Mental model

```text
holder-side share + admitted server-side share -> signature
```

Router decides whether the operation may reach signing. SigningWorker
participates only after Router admission. Ed25519 Streaming Yao and ECDSA
threshold-PRF derivation appear in lifecycle ceremonies; normal signing spends
the already-derived shares and presignature state.

## Session identity versus signing authority

Threshold signing tracks independent lifecycle identities:

| Identity                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `thresholdSessionId`          | Identifies the threshold protocol session and its signing material. Protocol state, restored holder material, and server material must all refer to this id. |
| `AuthorizationGrantRef`       | Identifies the reusable Wallet Session authorization.                                                                                                        |
| `walletSessionId` + `quotaId` | Identify the Wallet Session and its server-owned remaining uses.                                                                                             |
| `AuthorizedOperationId`       | Identifies one exact authorized operation for reusable or verified-step-up admission.                                                                        |

The protocol session selects threshold material. Wallet Session quota or an
authorized operation determines whether the operation may execute.

## Material readiness

Worker-owned material is not sign-ready just because a persisted record mentions
it. Browser workers are runtime-local, so material must be loaded and validated
against the current authorization source, authorized operation, threshold
session, signing root, Router A/B scope, and worker identity.

The practical states are:

| State            | Meaning                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auth-ready       | Wallet Session auth and quota exist.                                 |
| Restore-ready    | Durable sealed material exists and can be restored before signing.   |
| Material pending | The record has a material hint, but the worker has not validated it. |
| Sign-ready       | The worker has validated the material for the exact current binding. |

Normal signing starts only from sign-ready state. Restore and step-up are
separate phases that must complete before final signing.
