# Delegation

Delegation gives another device, agent, or service a bounded signing lane. The
lane has its own holder share package, server-side admission state, policy,
epoch, budget, expiry, and audit trail.

Delegation is address-preserving when it refreshes or adds lane shares for the
same wallet key. Wallet rekey is a separate operation.
