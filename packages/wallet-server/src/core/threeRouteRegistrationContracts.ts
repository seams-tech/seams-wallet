/**
 * Refactor 94C: the three-route registration wire contract, frozen at the
 * 2026-07-28 checkpoint (docs/refactor-94C-product-contract.md §2).
 *
 * Everything here derives from the existing contracts by indexed access, so a
 * change to an underlying payload surfaces as a compile error in this file
 * rather than silent drift. The routes:
 *
 *   1. POST /wallets/register/setup      — replaces grant + intent + start
 *   2. POST /wallets/register/respond    — replaces derivation/respond
 *   3. POST /wallets/register/activate   — replaces derivation/activate + finalize
 *
 * Design rules encoded in the shapes:
 * - The client carries exactly one opaque signed payload (`signedSetup`) and
 *   never parses it. Policy does not cross the public wire: the Gateway mints
 *   an internal Router-policy JWT per concrete Router call.
 * - Each route binds its own canonical `PublicDigest32` over that route's
 *   canonical encoded bytes; no signed payload satisfies a route it was not
 *   minted for.
 * - Route 3's completion row stores the credential-free committed projection
 *   and request fingerprint. A direct-capability first response carries the
 *   ephemeral primary credential after the receipt CAS; exact retry returns
 *   `already_committed` with the stable projection and no credential. The
 *   receipt projection retains the parent session expiry. A conflicting
 *   fingerprint returns the typed conflict.
 * - The V2 wire contract has no legacy fields or dual-write.
