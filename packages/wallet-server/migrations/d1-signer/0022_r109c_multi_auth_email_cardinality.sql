-- Refactor 109C: give Email OTP auth methods their canonical provider identity
-- and enforce one active Email method per authority.
--
-- R103E's V2 Email branch stores `email_hash_hex` and a
-- `registration_authority_id` — the OTP challenge that happened to create the
-- method. That is provenance, not identity: `EmailOtpWalletAuthAuthority`
-- needs `provider` and `providerUserId`, and R103E worked around their absence
-- by inferring the subject from an installation's own Ed25519 lanes and
-- requiring exactly one such subject per wallet. That inference cannot survive
-- a wallet with more than one Email method, which is precisely what R109C and
-- R109D create.
--
-- Forward-only. Migrations 0011 and 0012 are applied and are not rewritten;
-- 0011 dropped the wallet-wide Email uniqueness index deliberately, so linked
-- devices could share one verified address, and this migration replaces it
-- with the per-authority constraint rather than restoring it.

-- The provider identity, joined from the wallet's canonical enrollment.
