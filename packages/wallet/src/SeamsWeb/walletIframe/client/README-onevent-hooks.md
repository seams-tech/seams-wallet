# Wallet Iframe onEvent Bridging

This document explains how app-provided `onEvent` callbacks are bridged across the wallet iframe boundary. The iframe protocol uses a serializable `PROGRESS` envelope whose payload is a public v2 `WalletFlowEvent`.

This is the app-facing progress path. Lower-level signer worker progress is private unless it is explicitly mapped into one of these public wallet flow events.

## How It Works

1. Parent -> Child (RPC without functions)

- Parent sends a `PM_*` envelope. Functions in request payloads/options are stripped before crossing the iframe boundary.
- The parent registers the original app callback locally as a request-scoped `onProgress` handler.

```ts
// Parent app code
await walletRouter.registerWallet({
  wallet: { kind: 'server_allocated' },
  rpId,
  authMethod: { kind: 'passkey' },
  signerSelection,
  options: {
    onEvent: (ev) => {
      // ev is RegistrationFlowEvent
    },
  },
});
```

2. Child emits PROGRESS from its `onEvent`

- The wallet host wraps `SeamsWeb` calls and translates `onEvent(ev)` into:
  `post({ type: 'PROGRESS', requestId, payload: ev })`.
- Payloads use the v2 wallet flow event envelope:
  `RegistrationFlowEvent | UnlockFlowEvent | SigningFlowEvent | LinkDeviceFlowEvent | AccountSyncFlowEvent | KeyExportFlowEvent`.
- Email OTP registration/unlock/capability calls owned by the iframe are also wrapped with this bridge, so Email OTP worker progress mapped inside the iframe reaches the parent before the final result.
- Key export viewer lifecycle is wrapped the same way: viewer open/close callbacks become `key_export.viewer.opened` and `key_export.viewer.closed` progress events.

3. Parent bridges PROGRESS -> onEvent

- For each request, the client registers an `onProgress` handler created via `wrapOnEvent(onEvent, isXxxFlowEvent)`.
- When a `PROGRESS` message arrives, the client:
  - correlates by `requestId`
  - routes through a small `OnEventsProgressBus`
  - invokes the stored `onProgress`, which safely narrows by `event.version` and `event.flow`, then forwards to your `onEvent`.

4. Completion

- Child posts `PM_RESULT` (success) or `ERROR` (failure). The pending entry resolves/rejects and, unless `sticky` is set, progress delivery is unregistered.

## Message Shapes (child -> parent)

- PROGRESS: `{ type: 'PROGRESS', requestId: string, payload: WalletFlowEvent }`
- PM_RESULT: `{ type: 'PM_RESULT', requestId: string, payload: { ok: true, result: unknown } }`
- ERROR: `{ type: 'ERROR', requestId: string, payload: { code: string, message: string, details?: unknown } }`

Ordering is FIFO per `requestId`.

## Where The Bridging Lives (code)

- Host posts PROGRESS from `onEvent`:
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/host/wallet-iframe-handlers.ts`
    - `withProgress()` wraps host-side SDK calls and posts `PROGRESS`.
    - Covered flows include registration, unlock, Email OTP registration/unlock/capability calls, signing, link device, wallet recovery, account sync, and key export.
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/host/index.ts`
    - Owns the host `postProgress()` send path.
- Client receives PROGRESS and invokes app `onEvent` via wrapper:
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/client/router.ts`
    - `post()` registers `{ onProgress }` per request
    - `onPortMessage()` dispatches `PROGRESS` to `OnEventsProgressBus`
    - `wrapOnEvent(onEvent, isXxxFlowEvent)` narrows `ProgressPayload` before calling `onEvent`
- Message types:
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/shared/messages.ts` (`ProgressPayload`, PROGRESS/PM_RESULT/ERROR envelopes, `options.sticky`)
- Surface behavior:
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/client/router.ts`
    - starts and finishes correlated foreground surfaces.
  - `src/SeamsWeb/walletIframe/client/progress/on-events-progress-bus.ts`
    - routes public progress content and diagnostics without changing iframe visibility.

## Key Export Overlay Lifecycle

Key export is a typed progress flow named `key_export`. The export viewer uses `interaction.kind: 'key_export_viewer'`.

| Phase | Surface content |
| --- | --- |
| `key_export.auth.passkey.prompt.started` | passkey prompt started |
| `key_export.auth.passkey.prompt.succeeded` | passkey prompt succeeded |
| `key_export.viewer.opened` | viewer opened |
| `key_export.viewer.closed` | viewer closed |
| `key_export.completed` | completed |
| `key_export.failed` | failed |
| `key_export.cancelled` | cancelled |

Export requests use a sticky progress subscription because the drawer can open after the initial `PM_RESULT`. The `modal_key_export_confirm` surface remains active until the host emits a terminal progress event for the same request.

Generic wallet window messages such as `WALLET_UI_CLOSED` are not used by the router to control key export visibility.

## Event Layers

There are two progress layers:

1. Public app callbacks receive v2 `WalletFlowEvent` payloads.
2. Signer workers may emit private worker progress. Worker progress is mapped into public events only at deliberate flow boundaries.

Current worker behavior:

- NEAR signer worker progress remains private to the signer orchestration.
- Email OTP worker progress is mapped into public registration/unlock events for direct SDK and iframe-owned Email OTP flows.
- EVM and Tempo signer workers emit private RPC progress frames for transport visibility. These are not forwarded directly to app `onEvent` callbacks.

## Notes

- No functions ever cross the boundary; app callbacks run in the parent only.
- Timeouts are refreshed on each `PROGRESS` received.
- Type guards (`isRegistrationFlowEvent`, `isUnlockFlowEvent`, `isSigningFlowEvent`, `isKeyExportFlowEvent`, etc.) ensure your `onEvent` only receives the expected v2 flow shape.
- `event.step` is a per-flow ordinal derived from `event.phase`.
- `event.message` is canonical user-facing copy from `sdkSentEvents.ts` unless a flow deliberately overrides it for context.
- Use `sticky` when a flow should keep receiving status after the main result (e.g., certain device-linking screens and key export viewer lifecycle).
