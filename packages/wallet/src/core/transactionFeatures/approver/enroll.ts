/**
 * One enrollment: record the phrases of Wallet core on the VoiceID surface, then ask core to
 * enroll exactly these recordings. Core has the owner sign one message that authorizes them
 * and sends them, sealed, to the verifier, which stores the template. The plugin holds no
 * audio: each recording is a handle of core.
 *
 * The card of the last phrase stays open until the end, so no gap shows while core prepares
 * the message: it shows the wait, steps aside while the Wallet confirm is open, and then it
 * shows the verifier's work and the result.
 *
 * When VoiceID was turned on in the same flow, its samples are the recordings, so the owner
 * records one set for both.
