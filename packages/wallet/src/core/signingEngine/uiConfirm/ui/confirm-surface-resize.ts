/**
 * Host-driven height changes for wallet-iframe confirmations.
 *
 * In the wallet-iframe modal surface the parent window sizes the iframe to hug
 * this confirmer (surface-measurement-reporter.ts) and eases the box to every
 * new size it hears about (OverlayController.startSurfaceResize). Content that
 * animates its own height fights that ease: every frame of the animation posts
 * a fresh measurement, the box restarts its ease from wherever it is, and the
 * card — anchored to the iframe's top-left and already at full height — is
 * clipped by an iframe still catching up.
 *
 * So the order is reversed here. A component about to change height clamps
 * itself at its pre-change height and announces the change; the confirmer host
 * is pinned to the size it is heading for — exactly one measurement, so the
 * parent runs exactly one ease — and the component is then driven from the
 * room the iframe has actually made available, frame by frame. The content can
 * never outrun the box, whatever the parent's easing (or its absence under
 * reduced motion) turns out to be.
 *
 * The host is a transparent shell in that surface, so pinning it taller or
 * shorter than its content is invisible. The pin goes through a constructable
 * stylesheet because the wallet origin ships `style-src-attr 'none'`.
 *
 * Refactor 116 owns the rules this module enforces; see
 * `docs/refactor-116-lit-component-consolidation.md`.
