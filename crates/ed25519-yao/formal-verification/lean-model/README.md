# Ed25519 Yao Lean Model

The current FV1 model contains exactly 169 theorems.

The FV1 Lean model contains three manifest rehearsal theorems for distinct
activation/export family bytes, seven digest slots, and thirteen metrics. Nine
additional structural party-view theorems model profile-neutral output custody:
role separation, public-only infrastructure views, export-client-only seed
visibility, a public-only SigningWorker across all five frozen stages, metadata-
only activation, and static single-Deriver observation.

Twenty-two evaluation-input policy theorems model the same five frozen lifecycle
stages with family-specific value classes. They establish the exact four
role-local activation inputs for registration, recovery, and refresh; the exact
two role-local seed-domain inputs for export; the absence of activation inputs
and coins; private-input-free client and infrastructure views; peer-input
exclusion; family-correct use of functionality-owned output-sharing coins; the
exact stage/request/plan/count and pre-state-class tables; the seven-role
universe; and exact static A/B observation.

Across the five frozen host output stages, the SigningWorker has common public
metadata only. Actual package opening and an activated/delivered SigningWorker
state remain outside this model and require a later normative stage.

These party-view theorems are policy-shape evidence. They do not establish
noninterference, real/ideal security, protocol privacy, delivery, or production
custody.

The evaluation-input model is also policy-shape evidence. Its pre-state theorem
classifies stages and does not authenticate a store or companion artifact. It
has no executable runtime bridge and makes no noninterference, protocol-
security, coin-sampling, or production-custody claim.

Four uniform-abort theorems freeze the exact four public fields, exclude
request-context, authorization, Deriver-blame, and private-payload fields, and
assign the same redacted code and terminal state to all five request kinds.
They do not prove when an implementation aborts, timing equivalence, selective-
failure resistance, or correctness with abort.

Seven evaluator-abort theorems freeze the four evaluator request kinds,
activation exclusion, the unregistered/credential-suspended/registered state table, self-loop
transition, exact seven-role set, and common-only uniform-abort field view.
They do not prove durable state, ticket destruction, delivery, or timing.

Seven export-delivery theorems freeze authorization as unconsumed at output
commitment and uncertainty, consumed at release, exact identity preservation
through uncertainty and redelivery, Client-only seed visibility, and zero
private-evaluation work. They do not prove ciphertext opening, authenticated
transport, durable replay, acknowledgement, or selected-profile security.

Ten activation-delivery theorems freeze the not-issued, unconsumed, and
consumed authorization timeline; exact custody through uncertainty and
redelivery; atomic distinct Client and SigningWorker capabilities; released
Client scalar reconstruction; typed worker-authority identity; and zero private
work for uncertainty, release, and redelivery. They are host-only structural
evidence and do not prove ciphertext opening, authenticated transport, durable
replay, complete runtime views, or selected-profile security.

Twelve activation-recipient party-view theorems freeze the two post-release
stages and seven roles; empty pre-release extensions; exact Client scalar and
opaque SigningWorker authority custody at release; sealed SigningWorker custody
after activation; identity continuity; redelivery stability; and exclusion of
retained Deriver shares from every recipient extension. They are host-only
policy-shape evidence and do not prove frames, durable delivery, erasure,
noninterference, or selected-profile security.

Twelve recovery-credential transition theorems freeze active-to-suspended
cutover; evaluator-abort self-loop behavior; exact suspension retention through
output commitment, metadata consumption, recipient release, and worker
activation; verified-authority-only promotion; distinct replacement activation;
old-credential tombstoning; public-key, stable-scope, and A/B binding continuity;
strict state-version and activation-epoch advancement; and exclusion of dual
active credentials. They are construction-independent policy-shape evidence and
do not prove durable transactions, recovery proof verification, authenticated
transport, crash recovery, or selected-profile security.

Twelve export evaluator-authorization theorems require separate Deriver A and B
verified capabilities, distinct role authorities, and equality of their request,
authorization, transcript, provenance pair, authenticated store state/identity,
and one-use execution bindings. They also freeze exactly one accepted export
evaluation, preserve the acceptance-pair digest through output commitment and
release, and move authorization from unconsumed to consumed. These are host-only
capability and equality theorems. Signature unforgeability, trusted A/B key
distribution, admission-clock integrity, authorization-record policy validity,
durable replay, transport, constant-time execution, and P0-P3 protocol security
remain assumptions or later obligations.

Twelve registration evaluator-admission theorems freeze the public
unregistered pre-state classification, durable identity scope,
request/authorization/transcript/intent/provenance binding, both opaque
input-selection evidence identities, checked-at expiry, activation epoch and
execution identity, exactly one evaluation, candidate/receipt identity,
candidate retention through metadata and worker activation, and terminal
selection retention on abort. They do not prove authenticated absence, durable
uniqueness, input-opening consistency, selected-profile security, or production
constant-time behavior.

Twelve recovery evaluator-admission theorems freeze the active-to-suspended
boundary; durable identity, request, authorization, transcript, ordered
provenance, authenticated store authority, complete registered identity,
credential transition, both continuity-evidence identities, checked-at expiry,
strict activation-epoch advancement, and execution identity; exactly one
evaluation; terminal retention through output commitment and worker activation;
and exact suspension, terminal, and burned-execution retention on abort. They do
not prove same-root evidence validity, selected-mechanism acceptance,
authenticated store verification, durable replay, selected-profile security, or
production constant-time behavior.

Twelve refresh evaluator-admission theorems freeze the active-to-prepared
boundary; durable identity, request, authorization, transcript, ordered
provenance, authenticated store authority, complete current identity, complete
next Deriver role states, both continuity-evidence identities, checked-at
expiry, strict activation and role-state epoch advancement, and execution
identity; exactly one evaluation; terminal retention through output commitment,
metadata consumption, worker activation, and promotion; current identity
continuity into the promoted state; and exact current-active state, terminal,
and burned-execution retention on abort. They do not prove opposite-delta proof
validity, refresh-delta entropy or anti-bias, selected-mechanism acceptance,
authenticated store cryptography, durable replay, selected-profile security,
or production constant-time behavior.

Twenty-four semantic-frame party-view theorems freeze exactly eleven directed
frame classes, eleven delivery states, seven roles, the activation-family,
activation-control, export/redelivery, and evaluator-abort trace shapes,
activation's zero evaluator frames, export's exclusion of worker states and
frames, terminal abort, and exact recipient-redelivery identity. They also
freeze cumulative role-local value-learning labels: Client role-scoped input,
own Deriver inputs, protocol randomness and output packages, Router-only staged
control/input-envelope/output-package/delivery-receipt labels, release-scoped Client
and SigningWorker outputs, Diagnostics observation of every frame direction,
Observer observation of none, private-value exclusions, and monotonic retention
across every success and abort transition. The closed corruption surface has
exactly ten markers, excludes A+B and Client/SigningWorker corruption, and
exposes only four typed interface shapes. These are structural policy claims.
They do not provide runtime frame bytes, durable state or transactions,
transport/authentication/timing behavior, a simulator, indistinguishability,
selected-profile satisfaction, or a protocol-security theorem.

Eleven passive-security theorems define a conditional hybrid-composition
scaffold for activation/export and passive Deriver A/B. The observed view
contains typed corrupted inputs and random tape, authorized package shares,
message payload bytes, local state, ordered messages, and transcript bytes.
The ideal simulator is definitionally independent of honest private inputs and
real coins. Lean defines finite all-distinguisher acceptance-count bounds and
proves that five supplied adjacent-transition bounds add to the four
role/family bounds. Export Deriver A has a concrete typed simulator input tied
to the generated production public view. Production payload semantics,
nonvacuous transition bounds, and primitive reductions remain uninstantiated.

```sh
cargo yao-fv lean-check
```

The task builds the explicit `Ed25519YaoModel` target, checks an exact nonzero
theorem count, and requires its `.olean` output. This handwritten model has no
general generated production or Verus bridge. `RuntimePublicShape.lean` is
regenerated from production executions and checked byte for byte. Production
payload extraction, a discharged primitive-security bound, active-security
results, and a complete protocol-security theorem remain open.
