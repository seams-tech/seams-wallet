# Fixed 2-of-2 ECDSA Online Lifecycle v1

Status: complete local implementation map. The persistent lifecycle contract,
encrypted IndexedDB Client adapter, and atomic SigningWorker adapter are
integrated. Bounded independent cryptographic review remains the local
production-promotion gate.

## Scope and roles

The online kernel has exactly two roles:

- Client emits one signature share; and
- SigningWorker combines that share with its local share, verifies the final
  signature, and returns the recoverable 65-byte signature.

Participant identifiers, threshold, role ordering, and Lagrange coefficients
are fixed by the implementation. The public API has no generic participant
collection, threshold, or role selector.

## One-use state machine

Each role follows the same consuming lifecycle:

```text
available material
    -> reserved material
    -> committed-use material
    -> output or error
    -> dropped and zeroized
```

`reserve` consumes available material. `commit` consumes reserved material and
binds it to the online request's expected presignature point `R`. The share and
finalization entrypoints consume committed-use material. A failed transition
also consumes its input, so the same Rust value cannot re-enter the protocol.

The kernel deliberately has no reusable completed-session value.
`router-ab-ecdsa-pool` defines the exact persistent record key, revisions,
forward-only transitions, terminal reasons, and compare-and-swap mutations.
The browser and SigningWorker adapters atomically apply that contract before
releasing an online output and retain a tombstone after timeouts, ambiguous
delivery, crashes, and peer aborts.

## Two-role rerandomization coin

The existing prepare/finalize exchange also realizes the public coin without
another network round trip:

```text
client_contribution32 <- CSPRNG(32)
client_commitment32 = SHA-256(
    "router-ab-ecdsa-derivation/client-rerandomization-commitment/v1" ||
    client_contribution32
)

signing_worker_contribution32 <- CSPRNG(32)  // after prepare admission
entropy32 = client_contribution32 XOR signing_worker_contribution32
```

Prepare binds `client_commitment32` into the reservation digest. The
SigningWorker persists its contribution before returning it. Finalize carries
the Client opening; the SigningWorker derives its commitment and requires the
resulting prepare digest to equal the reserved digest before committed material
is exposed. Mismatch, timeout, abort, and ambiguous delivery are terminal burns.

If the Client is honest, its committed uniform value remains hidden when the
SigningWorker selects its contribution. If the SigningWorker is honest, its
post-admission uniform contribution makes the XOR uniform even for a malicious
Client. SHA-256 binding prevents the Client from adapting its opening after the
SigningWorker reveal. Fairness and availability under selective abort remain
excluded claims.

## Requirement-to-code map

| OL-INPUT-01 | Points and scalars are parsed once into precise internal values; identity points, non-canonical scalars, and zero `k` shares are rejected. | `src/lib.rs:124-183`, `src/lib.rs:330-349` | Full in-kernel | 1.00 |
| OL-ZEROIZE-01 | Secret material, digest, entropy, and HKDF candidates are zeroized when their owner is dropped or the derivation finishes. | `src/lib.rs:60-66`, `src/lib.rs:136-144`, `src/lib.rs:299-320` | Full in-kernel | 0.99 |
| OL-SHARE-01 | The fixed Client and SigningWorker equations reproduce the pinned NEAR semantic outputs. | `src/lib.rs:223-257`; `../router-ab-ecdsa-near-oracle-tests/tests/online_parity.rs` | Full for the pinned valid trace | 1.00 |

| OL-COIN-01 | Either honest signing role makes rerandomization entropy unpredictable to the corrupt peer. | Prepare request digest binds the Client SHA-256 commitment; SigningWorker samples and persists its contribution only after admission; finalize opens the commitment before material access; the kernel XORs the two contributions before the context-bound HKDF. | Full composed integration | 0.99 |
| OL-CORPUS-01 | Valid and invalid behavior matches the bounded pinned NEAR oracle corpus. | Four semantic cases, the critical abort corpus, and the final signature parity vectors execute against the digest-pinned oracle manifest. | Full bounded corpus | 1.00 |

Line references describe checkpoint 10 and must be refreshed when the source
layout changes.

## Security boundary

The Rust type system establishes one-use behavior for a value inside one
process execution. The persistent lifecycle crate establishes the valid record
states and mutations. IndexedDB transactions and Durable Object execution
establish atomicity across retries and crashes. Each storage integration owns:

1. authenticated lookup of the exact wallet, account, scope, role, and pair;
2. atomic transition from available to reserved before either party starts;
3. terminal consumption before any signature share or final signature crosses
   the process boundary;
4. permanent tombstoning for success, rejection, timeout, crash recovery, and
   ambiguous delivery; and
5. rejection of cross-wallet, cross-account, cross-scope, cross-pair, and
   cross-request substitution.

The record schema and atomic transition API are isolated for review in
`../router-ab-ecdsa-pool/specs/persistent-pool-lifecycle-v1.md`. Concrete
adapter and fault evidence is indexed by
`docs/evidence/refactor-89/phase-e-local-artifacts-v1.json`.

## Verification evidence

Checkpoint 10 records all checkpoint 9 evidence plus:

- a dependency-free persistent pool lifecycle crate with exact bindings,
  monotonic revisions, forward-only consuming transitions, and absorbing
  tombstones;
- eight unit tests covering the valid lifecycle, stale compare-and-swap,
  timeout, substitution, crash, ambiguous delivery, peer abort, expiry, and
  epoch retirement;
- a compile-fail test proving terminal tombstones expose no revival path; and
- expanded production dependency/source guards covering the pool crate.

Checkpoint 9 also records:

- online unit test: exact frozen Client share and final signature, plus altered
  share, mismatched `R`, and wrong-public-key rejection;
- online compile-fail tests: no direct use from available material and no
  second commit of a consumed reservation;
- oracle test: exact Client share and final signature parity against the pinned
  NEAR implementation;
- automated normal and Wasm resolved-graph guards: no `threshold-signatures`,
  `signer-core`, futures family, generic threshold runtime, or unrelated curve
  library in the isolated production crates and online Client wrapper;
- browser Wasm release: 68,477 bytes raw, 31,432 bytes gzip-9, and 26,231 bytes
  Brotli-11; and
- ARM64 release static constant-time scan: zero errors; warnings are confined
  to public boundary parsing and public commitment mismatch control flow.

The static constant-time scanner is heuristic. Compiled-Wasm opcode inspection
is complete; conditional-branch dataflow and target-runtime timing remain
explicit non-claims. The production presign Client and SigningWorker wrappers
use the purpose-built fixed backend and exclude the NEAR dependency graph.
