# `router-ab-ecdsa-derivation` Lean Privacy Plan

Last updated: 2026-04-09

## Goal

Use Lean 4 for the narrow privacy claim that the server-visible staged boundary
cannot reveal threshold-derived private material.

Initial target:

1. the server cannot observe `canonical_x`
2. the server cannot observe `x_client`
3. the generated Rust boundary from `lean-boundary/` maps into that same
   handwritten server-visible model

## Plan Status

This track is now bootstrapped as a separate Lean workspace and intentionally
depends on the completed narrow boundary bridge.

The intended split is:

- Verus proves implementation-facing algebraic and retained-state invariants
- `lean-boundary/` proves the generated Rust boundary matches the handwritten
  staged boundary model
- `lean-privacy/` proves the server-visible staged boundary is insensitive to
  hidden threshold-derived private material

This privacy pass is now intentionally frozen at that server-visible staged
boundary. Client-side privacy claims remain out of scope for `router-ab-ecdsa-derivation`
unless a separate adversary model is introduced later.

The first widening slice beyond pure boundary non-observability is now in
place:

- explicit `ProtocolExecutionState`
- explicit `ClientSecretState` and `ServerSecretState`
- explicit `ClientObservableProfile` and `ServerObservableProfile`
- explicit non-export / explicit-export client and server view projections
- state-variation relations over shared client/server observable boundaries
- simulator inputs and compatibility theorems for observable-only non-export
  and explicit-export client/server views
- explicit observable-profile equivalence and indistinguishability relations
  over the frozen staged-boundary fields
- first reconstruction-style goals now exist for:
- `ServerCannotDeriveClientSecrets`
- `ClientCannotDeriveServerSecrets`
- `ServerCannotDeriveCanonicalSecret`
- `ServerCannotDeriveClientThresholdShare`
- field-based canonical-secret disclosure predicates now exist
- the explicit-export exception theorem now exists for policy-consistent
  canonical-secret disclosure
- widened generated-boundary client/server view mappings and theorem lifts now
  exist in `AeneasBridge.lean`

      with explicit `ServerSecretState`.

- [x] Extend
      [RouterAbEcdsaDerivationPrivacy/AeneasBridge.lean](/Users/pta/Dev/rust/simple-threshold-signer/crates/router-ab-ecdsa-derivation/formal-verification/lean-privacy/RouterAbEcdsaDerivationPrivacy/AeneasBridge.lean)

### Phase P8: Out Of Scope Unless Re-Decided

- [x] Do not widen this track into transport/runtime orchestration proofs.
- [x] Do not widen this track into side-channel claims.
- [x] Keep implementation-facing algebraic proofs in Verus.

## Current Scope

The current proof boundary is intentionally frozen at:

- the handwritten staged boundary model in
  [../../lean-boundary/RouterAbEcdsaDerivationBoundary/Scope.lean](/Users/pta/Dev/rust/simple-threshold-signer/crates/router-ab-ecdsa-derivation/formal-verification/lean-boundary/RouterAbEcdsaDerivationBoundary/Scope.lean)
- the generated Rust boundary bridge in
  [../../lean-boundary/RouterAbEcdsaDerivationBoundary/GeneratedVisibleBoundary.lean](/Users/pta/Dev/rust/simple-threshold-signer/crates/router-ab-ecdsa-derivation/formal-verification/lean-boundary/RouterAbEcdsaDerivationBoundary/GeneratedVisibleBoundary.lean)

This privacy pass does not attempt to prove hidden-eval compilation, transport,
or runtime orchestration semantics.

Current decision:

- keep this privacy track frozen at the current server-visible staged boundary
- keep boundary-level client/server non-derivability in scope, while richer
  client-adversary models stay out of scope
- widen only if there is a concrete hidden-eval or client-adversary proof need
- keep hidden-eval compiler correctness, transport/runtime orchestration, and
  side-channel claims out of this track
- keep implementation-facing algebraic proofs in Verus

## Next Expansion: Hidden-Eval And Runtime-Seam Privacy

If we widen beyond the current frozen staged-boundary model, the next step
should be a narrow hidden-eval/compiler and transport/state-seam expansion.

That means:

- keep proving secrecy over explicit boundary models
- do not jump directly to "prove the whole runtime"
- treat side-channel resistance as a separate security-engineering track

### Phase P9: Hidden-Eval/Compiler Boundary Model

- [x] add a handwritten Lean model for the hidden-eval/compiler-facing
      boundary
- [x] define the exact observable fields at that seam for non-export and
      explicit-export flows
- [x] define which hidden materials may vary behind that seam while preserving
      the same observable hidden-eval/compiler boundary
- [x] restate the current secrecy goals over hidden-eval/compiler-boundary
      state pairs instead of only staged-boundary state pairs

### Phase P10: Transport And Persisted-State Exclusion

- [x] add a handwritten model for transport-visible non-export messages
- [x] add a handwritten model for transport-visible explicit-export messages
- [x] add a handwritten model for persisted staged runtime state
- [x] define field-level disclosure predicates for those message/state models
- [x] prove forbidden secret material is absent from non-export transport
      messages
- [x] prove forbidden secret material is absent from persisted staged runtime
      state after the accepted boundary
- [x] prove explicit export remains the only allowed canonical-secret
      disclosure exception at the transport/state layer

### Phase P11: Generated-Boundary Lift For The New Seam

- [x] extend the `lean-boundary/` extraction path to the hidden-eval/compiler
      facade
- [x] map the generated hidden-eval/compiler artifact into the new handwritten
      privacy model
- [x] lift the hidden-eval/compiler secrecy theorems onto the generated Rust
      boundary
- [x] add anti-drift checks so the Rust hidden-eval/compiler seam cannot move
      without updating the Lean model

### Still Out Of Scope

- [ ] do not widen this track into full runtime orchestration proofs
- [ ] do not widen this track into compiler correctness beyond the frozen
      hidden-eval/compiler-facing facade
- [ ] do not widen this track into side-channel claims
