# Intended Behaviours

Date created: 2026-05-30

Status: source-of-truth behavioural contract.

This document defines expected wallet behaviour across passkey and Email OTP
accounts. Refactor plans and tests should point back here when deciding whether
new code is correct.

E2E enforcement lives in `tests/e2e/intended-behaviours` and follows
[Spec 9: Behaviour and test authority](spec-9-behaviour-and-test-authority.md).

## Terms

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `walletId`           | Durable wallet identity. For current NEAR-backed wallets this is often the NEAR account id, but code must treat it as the wallet id. |
| `providerSubject`    | External identity-provider subject, such as a Google subject used by Email OTP registration.                                         |
| `challengeSubjectId` | Subject stored on an Email OTP challenge. For Google Email OTP it must match `providerSubject`.                                      |
| `walletSessionId`    | Exact authenticated Wallet Session identity bound to one wallet, authority, auth method, and quota.                                |
| `quotaId`            | Server-authoritative remaining-use, expiry, and lifecycle quota for that exact Wallet Session.                                      |
| `capabilityGrantId`  | Exact one-operation authority bound to an operation, capability, and material activation.                                            |
| `thresholdSessionId` | Cryptographic signing-session id for Ed25519 or ECDSA material.                                                                      |
| `chainTarget`        | Concrete ECDSA signing target, such as Tempo testnet or Arc EVM testnet.                                                             |
| `warm session`       | Short-lived multi-use signing state created by registration or exact-method unlock.                                                  |
| `step-up auth`       | Same-method fresh authorization scoped to one privileged operation.                                                                  |
| `owner proof`        | Server-internal passkey or Email OTP verification result consumed once to issue one exact Wallet Session and its primary operation credential, or authorize one exact operation. |
| `operation credential` | Opaque primary or hosted credential bound to one exact Wallet Session; the server resolves its identity, quota, expiry, and revocation state. |
| `walletAuthorityId`  | Opaque identity of one permissioned wallet authority and its exact signer activations.                                               |
| `walletAuthMethodId` | Opaque identity of one Passkey or Email OTP method attached to a wallet authority.                                                   |
| `deviceId`           | Installation identity for one wallet authority on one browser or device; it is not a hardware fingerprint.                           |

## Global Invariants

- Passkey and Email OTP are separate auth methods. A flow selected as
  `email_otp` must not call passkey/WebAuthn credential lookup. A flow selected
  as `passkey` must not call Email OTP verification.
- Registration must persist the configured signer inventory and establish one
  exact Wallet Session for the authenticated registration authority. Default
  wallet unlock hydrates that durable inventory; explicit partial unlock
  hydrates only the requested lane subset.
- Tenant-root operational-share rotation preserves existing wallet signing
  keys and leaves normal signing available while a Deriver is unavailable.
  New derivation ceremonies may wait for rotation to finish. The local contract
  `tenant-root.rotation.contract.test.ts` verifies Ed25519 signatures before,
  during, and after a rotation held pending by a stopped Deriver.
  It also verifies warm Tempo and Arc/EVM signing after rotation, and preserves
  the original Ed25519 public key and ECDSA addresses through cold passkey unlock
  from empty browser storage and fresh-browser recovery using a code issued
  before rotation. A consumed recovery code remains unusable.
  Manual rotations have a one-minute cooldown in local development and a
  ten-minute production default. Retries resume the same operation during the
  cooldown. Retired-share cleanup receives fresh authorization when retried
  after the activation authorization expires.
  The dashboard resumes the server's pending rotation across tabs and reloads.
  A conflicting request is rejected and cannot become a queued later rotation.
- Transaction signing uses warm-session budget. It should not ask for step-up
  while a valid warm session has enough signature uses for the requested
  operation.
- Step-up authorizes one exact operation. It does not create, renew, or add
  budget to an exact Wallet Session.
- Key export always requires fresh operation-specific authorization. A normal
  transaction-signing warm session is not sufficient authority for export.
- ECDSA lanes are target-specific. Tempo and Arc/EVM may share key facts and
  source material, but readiness, budget lookup, and persistence must carry the
  concrete `chainTarget`.
- Page refresh must not create new authority by itself. It may rehydrate valid
  persisted/sealed session state. If rehydration fails or a session is expired
  or exhausted, the next operation must use normal unlock or step-up auth.
- Application authentication is outside the wallet SDK. An application token,
  cookie, user id, or provider session never proves wallet ownership.
- Primary and hosted operation credentials are opaque. Client code must not decode
  identity, budget, expiry, authority, or signing claims from them.

## Hosted Auth Menu Entry Point

When hosted wallet-iframe mode is configured, mounting `SeamsAuthMenu` opens one
`modal_auth_menu` surface in the wallet-origin iframe. The app document contains
only an inert lifecycle marker; auth inputs, progress, OTP prompts, and the final
CTA belong to the wallet origin.

- Login and registration prepare their asynchronous prerequisites before enabling
  the single wallet-origin CTA. The CTA starts the selected passkey ceremony from
  that wallet-origin activation.
- Registration uses the configured account-input policy and completes through the
  same prepared surface; it does not open a second registration-confirmation modal.
- The wallet host owns passkey and Email OTP validation, OTP state,
  registration continuation, and unlock continuation.
- A hosted-wallet handoff is single-use and bound to the application and wallet
  origins. The wallet iframe receives one short-lived hosted operation credential
  for the exact parent Wallet Session; the primary operation credential stays in
  the wallet origin and never reaches the outer application.
- The adapter emits exactly one terminal `HostedAuthMenuOutcome` for the session.
  Unmounting or closing cancels only that session and leaves direct
  `registerWallet()`, `addWalletSigner()`, and `unlock()` confirmation surfaces
  unchanged.

## Registration

### Passkey Account

Expected behaviour:

- Registration prompts for one passkey credential creation.
- The newly created passkey credential is bound to the wallet and stored as a
  passkey auth method.
- Registration returns after the wallet, auth method, configured ECDSA signer
  inventory, and exact Wallet Session are durable and the primary operation
  credential has been issued. Tempo and Arc/EVM signing may begin immediately.
- For a mixed signer set, Ed25519/NEAR provisioning continues under the same
  authenticated ceremony and publishes one of `near_pending`,
  `near_provisioning`, `near_ready`, or `near_failed_retryable`.
- NEAR signing becomes available at `near_ready` without a second passkey prompt.
  A retryable provisioning failure remains visible to the caller.
- ECDSA key export remains available while NEAR is pending and requires fresh
  export authorization.
- Passkey registration must not send or verify an Email OTP challenge.

Failure behaviour:

- If local persistence postconditions fail, registration must not report local
  success.
- If blockchain account creation has already happened, immutable chain-state
  rollback messaging must be separate from local persistence rollback/repair
  messaging.

### Email OTP Account

Expected behaviour:

- Registration sends one Email OTP code for the active registration attempt.
- The user may reroll the wallet name without sending another OTP code.
- The final wallet id may differ from the wallet id shown when the OTP was sent.
- The OTP remains valid for registration reroll only when the provider subject,
  challenged email, challenge id, org, owner-proof binding, and allowed
  registration purpose match.
- Registration stores the Email OTP auth method and binds it to the final
  wallet id.
- Registration returns after the wallet, Email OTP auth method, configured ECDSA
  signer inventory, and exact Wallet Session are durable and the primary
  operation credential has been issued. Tempo and Arc/EVM signing may begin
  immediately.
- For a mixed signer set, Ed25519/NEAR provisioning continues with the live
  registration factor and publishes one of `near_pending`,
  `near_provisioning`, `near_ready`, or `near_failed_retryable`.
- NEAR signing becomes available at `near_ready` without a second OTP
  verification. A retryable provisioning failure remains visible to the caller.
- ECDSA key export remains available while NEAR is pending and requires fresh
  export authorization.
- Email OTP registration must not create passkey-owned runtime material.
- Email OTP registration must not call passkey PRF/touch-confirm sealed restore.

Failure behaviour:

- A wallet-unlock OTP challenge must not satisfy registration verification
  unless the request carries an explicit registration reroll proof whose
  provider subject, challenged email, challenge id, org, and owner-proof binding
  match.
- A registration OTP challenge must not satisfy wallet-unlock verification.
- Reroll must fail with a precise challenge/proof mismatch code when the
  provider subject or challenged email differs.

### Page Refresh During Registration

Expected behaviour:

- Refreshing during registration completion may restore UI progress from durable
  registration attempt state when available.
- Refreshing must not send a second OTP solely because the wallet name changed.
- Refreshing must not finalize registration without the same required
  operation-bound owner proof.
- Retrying the same activation or deferred NEAR provisioning request uses the
  original ceremony and idempotency key. The server returns the credential-free
  V2 committed projection without repeating custody effects; a changed request
  under that key is refused.
- Local pending registration state remains invisible until one exact readwrite
  publication succeeds. A failed publication leaves it pending for an exact
  retry.
- A credential-free committed projection identifies the exact method required
  for a fresh unlock and never replays a primary operation credential.
- After completed registration, a refresh follows the exact-session restoration
  behaviour below.

## Wallet Unlock

### Passkey Account

Expected behaviour:

- Unlock prompts for the wallet's registered passkey.
- If the credential id is known, WebAuthn should request that credential
  directly so the browser does not show an unnecessary account picker.
- By default, unlock warms NEAR Ed25519 and configured ECDSA signing lanes.
- Callers may request an explicit subset, such as NEAR-only, ECDSA-only, or
  specific ECDSA targets, to avoid unnecessary unlock latency.
- Unlock issues one exact Wallet Session for the selected auth method and its
  primary operation credential. Local warm signing state can authorize multiple
  transactions within that session's quota.
- Unlock should not require Email OTP.
- Restoring durable key facts and display metadata must use local inventory without
  querying signing-session status. Readiness validation runs after hydration, with
  independent curve readers sharing one operation-scoped status Promise. The same
  scope spans verification and post-hydration checks, then is discarded. Each
  later operation reads current expiry, revocation, and quota state. The mixed-wallet
  passkey unlock contract makes at most three post-verification status requests:
  one for unlock and one for each of its two explicit public session reads.
- Unlock should not delete durable sealed/session records that are needed for
  future refresh or recovery unless the user explicitly removes the wallet,
  device, auth method, or account.

Failure behaviour:

- If no passkey auth method or credential can be found for the wallet, unlock
  fails before reporting success.
- If requested signing lanes cannot be hydrated, unlock fails or reports a
  typed partial-hydration error before normal signing begins.

### Email OTP Account

Expected behaviour:

- Unlock sends one wallet-unlock OTP challenge.
- By default, verifying the OTP warms NEAR Ed25519 and configured ECDSA signing
  lanes.
- Callers may request an explicit subset, such as NEAR-only, ECDSA-only, or
  specific ECDSA targets, to avoid unnecessary unlock latency.
- Unlock issues one exact Wallet Session for the selected auth method and its
  primary operation credential. Local warm signing state can authorize multiple
  transactions within that session's quota.
- Unlock should not require passkey/WebAuthn.
- Unlock should not call passkey PRF/touch-confirm sealed restore.
- Default unlock should hydrate the same lane inventory as successful Email OTP
  registration for the same wallet and auth method. Explicit partial unlock
  should hydrate the requested lane subset only.

Failure behaviour:

- A registration OTP challenge must not unlock the wallet.
- A step-up/export OTP challenge must not unlock the wallet.
- Unlock must fail before reporting success if no usable Email OTP auth method
  exists for the wallet.

### Page Refresh After Unlock

Expected behaviour:

- Refresh may restore valid warm-session state from durable/sealed records
  without a user prompt.
- Refresh must preserve exact auth method, curve, chain target, session ids, and
  budget identity.
- If restored warm sessions are still valid, NEAR, Tempo, and EVM transaction
  signing should proceed without unlock or step-up prompts.
- If restored warm sessions are expired, exhausted, invalid, or missing, the
  wallet should require unlock or operation-specific step-up on the next
  privileged operation.
- Refresh must not silently switch an Email OTP wallet to passkey paths or a
  passkey wallet to Email OTP paths.
- Every unlock request names the exact `walletAuthMethodId`; a wallet-level
  method fallback is refused.
- A replayed unlock mint returns the exact committed session and quota identity
  without a credential. A fresh unlock through the exact method is required for
  a new primary operation credential.

## Account Recovery

### Passkey and Google / Email OTP Recovery Targets

Expected behaviour:

- The hosted login menu accepts one unused recovery code, resolves its wallet,
  and lets the user recover with a new Passkey or Google SSO with Email OTP.
- The recovery code is the sole wallet-recovery authorization. The selected
  target still proves its own factor: Passkey registration for Passkey, or a
  server-verified Google identity followed by Email OTP for Email OTP.
- The server selects one exact active method and custody envelope as the
  continuity anchor. Passkey-only, Email-only, and mixed-method wallets admit
  either recovery target.
- Finalization verifies the complete stored key manifest and preserves the
  registered NEAR, Tempo, and Arc/EVM public identities.
- Recovery-code consumption and installation of a fresh device authority,
  target method, signer activations, and method-bound custody envelope occur
  atomically. Existing methods, envelopes, authorities, linked devices, and
  Wallet Sessions remain active.
- Recovery finalization itself does not issue a Wallet Session. Recovery
  completion proceeds through normal login with the newly installed method; that
  login creates the fresh exact Wallet Session and primary operation credential.
- A consumed code cannot authorize a second recovery.
- Re-entering a consumed code, or entering a code held by another active
  recovery, reports that it has already been used and directs the owner to
  another code. An abandoned reservation becomes reusable after it expires.

Failure behaviour:

- The unauthenticated server boundary identifies an exact consumed code through
  its non-secret locator tombstone. Unknown wallets, malformed or unknown codes,
  target-policy mismatches, unsupported auth shapes, and unrelated conflicts
  retain the generic refusal.
- Precommit cancellation and definite failure leave the recovery code
  unconsumed.
- Recovery material, server diagnostics, and code values never enter hosted
  outcomes, parent-window messages, or logs.

## Transaction Signing

### Passkey Account

Expected behaviour:

- NEAR, Tempo, and EVM signing select an exact passkey lane for the requested
  curve and chain target.
- If the selected warm session has enough signature uses, signing proceeds
  without another prompt.
- The server resolves the operation credential to its exact Wallet Session and
  chooses exact admission, same-method step-up, or hard denial.
- NEAR action batching consumes one signature use per NEAR transaction, not one
  use per action.
- Multiple independent transactions in one signing request consume one
  signature use per transaction digest.
- Tempo and EVM each consume one signature use per transaction request unless a
  future batch API explicitly declares more.
- After successful signing, the Wallet Session quota is finalized exactly once.

Failure behaviour:

- If no exact lane exists, signing fails with a typed lane-selection error.
- If the exact lane exists but budget is exhausted or expired, signing plans
  same-method step-up.
- Passkey signing must not ask for Email OTP unless the user explicitly selected
  an Email OTP auth method for a wallet that supports it.

### Email OTP Account

Expected behaviour:

- NEAR, Tempo, and EVM signing select an exact Email OTP lane for the requested
  curve and chain target.
- If the selected warm session has enough signature uses, signing proceeds
  without another OTP.
- The server resolves the operation credential to its exact Wallet Session and
  chooses exact admission, same-method step-up, or hard denial.
- NEAR action batching consumes one signature use per NEAR transaction, not one
  use per action.
- Multiple independent transactions in one signing request consume one
  signature use per transaction digest.
- Tempo and EVM each consume one signature use per transaction request unless a
  future batch API explicitly declares more.
- ECDSA shared-key material may be sourced from another EVM-family target, but
  signing readiness and budget checks must remain exact to the requested
  `chainTarget`.
- After successful signing, the Wallet Session quota is finalized exactly once.

Failure behaviour:

- If no exact lane exists, signing fails with a typed lane-selection error.
- If the exact lane exists but budget is exhausted or expired, signing plans
  Email OTP step-up.
- Email OTP signing must not call WebAuthn credential lookup, passkey PRF, or
  passkey/touch-confirm sealed restore.

### Page Refresh Before Signing

Expected behaviour:

- A refreshed page may use restored warm sessions if they are exact, valid, and
  have enough budget.
- A refreshed page must re-read lane inventory before signing.
- A refreshed page must not rely on stale in-memory diagnostics or stale
  candidates from before refresh.
- If restoration cannot prove exact readiness, the signing flow must request
  unlock or same-method step-up.

## Step-Up Auth

### Passkey Account

Expected behaviour:

- Step-up uses the selected wallet's passkey auth method.
- If the credential id is known, WebAuthn should request that credential
  directly.
- Step-up is operation-specific and claims one quota-neutral authorized
  operation.
- Step-up preserves the existing key, lane, material activation, Wallet
  Session, and budget identity.
- Step-up for NEAR must not refresh ECDSA-only lanes unless the approved
  operation requires them.
- Step-up for Tempo/EVM must be exact to the requested ECDSA chain target.

Failure behaviour:

- Cancelling transaction review before the passkey prompt begins cancels only
  that operation and preserves the selected wallet authority.
- A cancelled passkey step-up prompt cancels the operation, leaves the wallet
  locked, and must not spend budget.
- A passkey step-up result cannot authorize an Email OTP lane.

### Email OTP Account

Expected behaviour:

- Step-up sends an operation-specific Email OTP challenge.
- Verifying the OTP claims one quota-neutral authorized operation.
- Step-up preserves the existing key, lane, material activation, Wallet
  Session, and budget identity.
- Step-up for NEAR must authorize the selected Ed25519 lane.
- Step-up for Tempo/EVM must authorize the selected ECDSA lane and exact chain
  target.
- Step-up should show one OTP prompt per approved operation.

Failure behaviour:

- A cancelled Email OTP step-up prompt cancels the operation, leaves the wallet
  locked, and must not spend budget. A failed OTP attempt cancels the operation
  without spending budget.
- An Email OTP step-up result cannot authorize a passkey lane.
- A step-up OTP challenge cannot be reused for wallet unlock, registration, or
  key export.

### Page Refresh During Step-Up

Expected behaviour:

- Refreshing during an incomplete step-up cancels or resumes only through an
  explicit operation-state path.
- A stale step-up challenge must not authorize a different operation after
  refresh.
- A completed step-up may be restored only if the restored lane is exact to the
  same wallet, auth method, operation, curve, chain target, and session ids.

## Key Export

### Passkey Account

Expected behaviour:

- Key export requires fresh export-scoped passkey authorization.
- A normal transaction-signing warm session is not enough to export keys.
- Ed25519 export selects an exact Ed25519 export lane.
- ECDSA export selects an exact ECDSA export lane for the requested chain target
  or shared EVM-family key, with source material explicitly resolved.
- Export opens the export viewer only after authorization and material
  preparation succeed.
- Export authorization is one-time or export-scoped according to policy.

Failure behaviour:

- Transaction step-up authorization must not be accepted for key export.
- If export material is unavailable, export fails with an exact export-lane or
  material error.
- Passkey export must not call Email OTP verification unless the user selected
  an Email OTP auth method for a wallet that supports it.

### Email OTP Account

Expected behaviour:

- Key export requires fresh export-scoped Email OTP authorization.
- A wallet-unlock OTP or transaction step-up OTP is not enough to export keys.
- Ed25519 export selects an exact Email OTP Ed25519 export lane.
- ECDSA export selects an exact Email OTP ECDSA export lane for the requested
  chain target or shared EVM-family key, with source material explicitly
  resolved.
- Export opens the export viewer only after authorization and material
  preparation succeed.
- Export must not call WebAuthn credential lookup, passkey PRF, or
  passkey/touch-confirm sealed restore.

Failure behaviour:

- Transaction step-up authorization must not be accepted for key export.
- Wallet-unlock authorization must not be accepted for key export.
- If export material is unavailable, export fails with an exact export-lane or
  material error.

### Page Refresh During Export

Expected behaviour:

- Refreshing during export must not leak key material or leave an export viewer
  authorized without fresh operation state.
- If export resumes after refresh, it must revalidate export-scoped
  authorization and exact lane/material identity.
- A transaction-signing session restored after refresh must not become export
  authority.

## Account Recovery

Code recovery selects an exact active method and custody envelope as its
continuity anchor. The source family does not constrain the selected recovery
target.

Expected behaviour:

- The hosted wallet-iframe menu accepts one unused recovery code. The server
  resolves the wallet from the code locator without an existing Passkey
  assertion, an old credential ID, or a client-supplied wallet or source
  method.
- Preparation reserves the code and binds an immutable Passkey or
  Google/Email target. Passkey creation and Google authentication each begin
  from their dedicated user action; Google recovery also requires the issued
  Email OTP before factor release.
- Finalization preserves every public wallet identity and atomically installs
  a fresh recovery authority, its target auth method, signer activations, and
  method-bound custody envelope while consuming one code. Existing methods,
  envelopes, authorities, linked devices, and Wallet Sessions stay active.
- Recovery restores local continuity against the fresh recovery authority.
- An existing synced Passkey on a sibling authority does not block creation of
  the fresh recovery authority's Passkey.
- The menu reports authentication only after normal login through the new
  Passkey or Google/Email method creates a fresh exact Wallet Session and
  primary operation credential for that method.
- The remaining recovery codes stay active. Reusing the consumed code reports
  that it has already been used and directs the owner to another code.

Failure behaviour:

- Cancellation before finalization leaves the code usable after its reservation
  expires and clears client-held recovery material.
- A different attempt presenting the code during that reservation receives the
  already-used response.
- A failed atomic finalization leaves all existing methods active and the code
  unconsumed. Transport uncertainty may replay the same exact additive
  finalization.
- Unknown wallets, unusable codes, target mismatch, and unsupported
  auth-method shapes expose no distinguishing recovery detail.

## Adding an Authentication Method

A wallet authority holds at most one Passkey method and one Email OTP method.
The product offers one **Add authentication method** action, and which branch it
runs is decided by the exact active inventory of the selected authority rather
than chosen by the caller.

- The action is offered only when the authority is missing a family, and
  disappears once both are active.
- Adding a family the authority already has answers `already_configured` at
  admission, before any target factor is verified and before any code is sent.
  Repeating an addition must not cost the user a verification.
- The source method supplies a fresh proof bound to that exact addition. The
  target factor is verified independently; the source proof never serves as
  target verification.
- The new method reuses the authority and device it was added to. It creates no
  authority, signer activation, share, public key, export root, or key manifest,
  and it carries forward whatever signer access the authority already has. A
  wallet owning one signer family gains a method that correctly claims only that
  family.
- The source method and its Wallet Session stay selected. The added method comes
  into use only through explicit selection, or through lock and unlock naming
  it; an unlock that names it moves the selection to it, and that move is
  allowed only between members of one authority.
- A Wallet Session names the exact method that opened it, not merely its family.
  Each sibling method may have its own active session. Replacing or revoking one
  method retires only that method's session, quota, and hosted children; sibling
  methods and their sessions remain active.
- Either sibling can revoke the other, proving with its own factor rather than
  the one being removed. The last remaining method cannot be revoked.
- Revoking a method must not prevent adding another of that family afterwards.

## Linked Devices

Expected behaviour:

- Opening authentication-method or linked-device inventory with an expired
  owner Wallet Session performs one same-method wallet unlock, then retries the
  inventory request once with the newly issued exact session. Cancelling the
  unlock leaves the inventory unavailable and never loops or reuses the rejected
  credential.
- Linking creates a fresh `deviceId`, `walletAuthorityId`,
  `walletAuthMethodId`, and signer activation for every signer family present
  on the source authority. The wallet's public signer identities remain
  unchanged, and Device 1's authority, methods, material, sessions, and
  revocation epoch remain unchanged.
- Device 2 never receives the wallet custody seed. An Ed25519 installation
  with `export_keys` receives only the one-use encrypted Yao Client export
  root and seals it under the verified target method.
- Activation gives Device 2 an exact Wallet Session and recipient-bound sealed
  operation-credential delivery. After the local worker opens it, Device 2 uses
  ordinary signing, export, reload, lock, unlock, inventory, and revocation
  paths. Those operations do not read the completed link session or repair
  missing material.
- Device inventory is derived from active wallet authorities with
  device-link provenance and their exact auth methods. A completed link
  session is temporary workflow state and is deleted after acknowledgement.
- A Passkey card displays server-derived authenticator metadata when it is
  available. An Email OTP card displays `Email OTP` and makes no browser,
  operating-system, provider, transport, sync, or hardware claim.
- Every card displays a stable shortened `deviceId`. Creation-order labels
  such as `Device 2` are not durable identity, and metadata must not imply an
  exact physical machine or exclusive possession of a synced Passkey.
- Device metadata is display and audit context only. Authorization, signing,
  export, unlock, and revocation never branch on labels, browser or operating-
  system names, providers, transports, or sync state.
- Raw User-Agent strings, attestation objects, PRF output, factor secrets, and
  Email OTP addresses do not enter the management response.
- User revocation targets one exact `walletAuthMethodId` and requires fresh
  proof from a different active method under a full-owner authority. Removing
  the wallet's final active method is refused without changing durable state.
- Revoking the final method attached to an authority retires that authority,
  invalidates its sessions, and disables its exact signer activations while
  leaving other methods, authorities, and devices operational.

Failure behaviour:

- Missing, duplicate, cross-wallet, wrong-kind, revoked, or digest-mismatched
  authority and auth-method records fail closed. Runtime operations do not
  select a sibling device or infer identity from timestamps or display data.
- An incomplete migrated enrollment returns `relink_required` at its boundary.
  Linking does not hydrate, recover, rotate, promote, or synthesize missing
  signer or export material.
- Retrying after the pending-authority commit reuses the exact authority,
  method, activation, package, and digest identities. It must not create a
  duplicate authority or signer activation.
- Activation replay returns the same exact session and sealed delivery.
  Acknowledgement cleanup is authenticated and remains resumable after the live
  link session is deleted.

## Test Matrix

Every release touching registration, auth methods, signing sessions, budget,
lane selection, worker material, or export should validate this matrix.

| Account type | Registration                            | Unlock                    | NEAR tx                   | Tempo tx                     | EVM tx                       | Step-up NEAR     | Step-up Tempo    | Step-up EVM      | Ed25519 export                | ECDSA export                | Page refresh                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Passkey      | ECDSA-ready; NEAR readiness is explicit | warms exact present lanes | available at `near_ready` | no prompt while budget valid | no prompt while budget valid | passkey prompt   | passkey prompt   | passkey prompt   | fresh auth after `near_ready` | fresh passkey export auth   | restores durable readiness and exact present lanes |
| Email OTP    | one OTP; reroll allowed; ECDSA-ready    | warms exact present lanes | available at `near_ready` | no OTP while budget valid    | no OTP while budget valid    | Email OTP prompt | Email OTP prompt | Email OTP prompt | fresh auth after `near_ready` | fresh Email OTP export auth | restores durable readiness and exact present lanes |

## Validation Mapping

Each row needs either an automated test or an explicit manual verification note
when a change touches registration, unlock, signing, step-up, export, session
restore, lane selection, or budget handling.

| Behaviour                                                                | Evidence                                                                     |

| Adding a method reuses the authority and creates no new signer material  | `tests/e2e/intended-behaviours/passkey.add-email-otp.contract.test.ts`       |
| An added Passkey unlocks, signs, and exports both families               | `tests/e2e/intended-behaviours/email-otp.add-passkey.contract.test.ts`       |
| An added Email OTP method unlocks through hosted Google and signs both families | `tests/e2e/intended-behaviours/passkey.add-email-otp.contract.test.ts` |

| Code recovery adds either target family and preserves public identities  | Intended-behaviour 2x2 recovery contracts                                    |
| Code recovery preserves source sessions and consumes exactly one code    | Intended-behaviour 2x2 recovery contracts                                    |
| Email OTP paths never call passkey credential lookup or PRF restore      | `tests/unit/emailOtpEd25519YaoExportRefresh.unit.test.ts`; `tests/unit/walletEmailOtpChallengeRoute.unit.test.ts` |
| ECDSA budget checks are exact to chain target                            | `tests/unit/emailOtpEcdsaUnlockExactSession.unit.test.ts`; `tests/unit/ecdsaMaterialActivationWalletStore.unit.test.ts` |

## Non-Goals

- Do not use passkey fallback paths to repair Email OTP state.
- Do not use Email OTP fallback paths to repair passkey state.
- Do not hide registration failures by relying on a later wallet unlock to fix
  local runtime state.
- Do not treat public ECDSA identity as signing material.
- Do not use session ids alone to identify ECDSA readiness or budget.
- Do not send extra OTP codes during registration reroll.
